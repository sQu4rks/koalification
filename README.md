koalifying php for a faster web

What is koalification
---------------------

Koalification is a simple php library set to provide abstraction for php-written web applications. Just to
clearify, this is no let-the-black-box-do-some-vuduu-stuff framework. You still keep full controlle of
your source code.

We currently provide:

* A simple Database Abstraction that maps your table to objects and provides higher-level functions to access your data
* A simple Template Engine that enables you to capsulate your content and data
* A simple but secure user authentification model to spin up a web app with backend quickly

You see the tendency here ?

First steps
-----------

1. Clone down the code
3. Run the manager.php script with init option. This will let you choose the database backend, generate SQL and classes for you
4. Develope your app
