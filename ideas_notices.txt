Folder structure ideas:

- admin 
  This folder contains all admin related files.
  If Koalification currently is not installed when this folder accessed it starts the setup routine.
  After installation this folder should be protected with the configured admin account and password.
  
The root directory contains the normal files for users/visitors.




Things which need to be clarified:

- Is there a setup required for every web application which contains the whole system? If not, how there will be the structure for one admin interface but a lot of different web applications?
- There should be a private directory to put template files etc. This cannot be done with authentication as these files are non-PHP and are not executed as script and just given to the browser if in a www-accessible folder. So there need to be two folder structures, one with private files and the other containing the web ressources.


Proposition for the two problems above:
There is one private folder structure containing all PHP classes and required templates, sqlite database if used. For every web application there will be a new folder containing the files for this specific application which is www-accessible. Also the basic Koalification app needs some sort of admin interface for the basic setup in a folder callable from a browser.
